`origami` is designed to help you manage local Docker environments for PHP applications.

It allows among other things to: install and manage a complete environment in a project, visualize status and logs of
the services, go inside a service, etc. It also offers the ability to have a global overview of all installed
environments and to perform the actions mentioned above without having to be in the project directory.

Basically, `origami` is an abstraction written in PHP of [Docker Compose][1] and [mkcert][2].

üì¶ Installing
-------------
You can install `origami` with Composer like any PHP dependency.
```
composer global require ajardin/origami
```

Once you have installed the binary, you can check the status of the application requirements.
```
origami --verbose
```

üöÄ Getting Started
------------------
1. Open a terminal in the directory of your project
2. Run `origami install`
3. Configure the environment of your choice
4. Run `origami start`
5. Open your favorite browser on your custom domain, or https://127.0.0.1/

**Note:** The configuration of your new environment can be found in the `var/docker/` directory of your project. This
is your own configuration. Feel free to edit it at your convenience. üòâ

‚úÖ Testing
----------
There is a Makefile that provides all the continuous integration processes.

```
$ make

üîç Architecture
---------------
`origami` is built on top of [Symfony][3], a popular PHP framework.

Unlike common Symfony projects, we use [Box][4] to package the tool into a single binary file. So that it's possible
to easily share it without installing all its dependencies, as it could potentially bring conflicts if other projects
with outdated dependencies are already globally installed on the local machine.

**Why PHP?** The main reason is that `origami` will focus on environments dedicated to PHP applications, and we would
like to facilitate the contribution process by using something well-known by our end-users.
